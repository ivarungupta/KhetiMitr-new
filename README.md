## Step-by-Step Guide

### Open VSCode and Navigate to Your Project:

1. Launch Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
2. Open the folder where your `main.py` file and other project files are located.

## Open Terminal in VSCode:

- Press `Ctrl+`` (backtick) to open the integrated terminal in VSCode. This terminal will be used for running commands.

## Set Up a Virtual Environment:

1. Navigate to your project directory in the terminal:
   ```sh
   cd path/to/your/project
    ```
2. Create a virtual environment named venv:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
    (On Windows)
    ```sh
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
    (On macOS/Linux)
    ```sh
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    
## Install Required Packages:
Install TensorFlow, Streamlit, and other dependencies listed in your `main.py`:

```sh
pip install tensorflow streamlit numpy
```

## Run the Streamlit Application:
Once installation is complete, start the Streamlit server:

```sh
streamlit run main.py
```
## Steps to Run the Project Again

### Open VSCode and Navigate to Your Project:
    1. Launch Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
    2. Open the folder where your `main.py` file and other project files are located.
       Open Terminal in VSCode:
    - Press `Ctrl+`` (backtick) to open the integrated terminal in VSCode. This terminal will be used for running commands.

    3. Activate the Virtual Environment:
    - Navigate to your project directory in the terminal:
          ```sh
      cd path/to/your/project
      ```
      for Windows
      ```sh
      .\venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
      for macOS/Linux
      ```sh
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

      4. Run the Streamlit Application:
       Once the virtual environment is activated, start the Streamlit server:
       ```sh
       streamlit run main.py
        ```
       This command will initialize the Streamlit server locally and open a new tab in your default web browser displaying your application.

## Navigate the Application:

In your web browser, you should see the application running with a sidebar offering different options (Home, About, Disease Recognition).
Upload an image on the Disease Recognition page to test your model's prediction.
